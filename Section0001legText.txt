Section 18 of Chapter 23 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out in paragraph 2 the following words "shall not" and inserting in place thereof the following: "shall" and also something else for testing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm also checking to see if this gets added.&lt;/div&gt;
